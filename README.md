# Feature_Selection
Feature Selection is the method of reducing the input variable to your model by using only relevant data and getting rid of noise in data. It is the process of automatically choosing relevant features for your machine learning model based on the type of problem you are trying to solve
### In this work we have done pearson correlation feature selection.
pearson correlation is most appropriate for measurments taken from an interval scale.
1. the relationship is linear.
2. both variables are quantitative
3. normally distributed
4. have no outlier
